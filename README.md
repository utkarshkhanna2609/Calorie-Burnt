# Calorie-Burnt
A Trained ML model, to predict the calories burnt by the person as per the weight, height, gender, heart rate etc.
The model is trained using the XGBoost Regressor, you can use the code to check how the data is working,
the Mean Absolute Error we get is 1.479, this is a very low number as per the domain we are working on.

You may use the model, as per your liking, I have given the trained model which is ready to download.
